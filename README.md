# Interactive Machine Learning Interface (Streamlit)

An interactive web-based machine learning application built with **Streamlit**.
This project allows users to upload their own datasets, perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA),
and train common machine learning models for **classification** and **regression** tasks
through a simple graphical interface.

This project was developed as part of a machine learning coursework / practice project.

- Interactive data preview and basic preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Scatter plot
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) calculation
- Feature and target selection
- Support for both **classification** and **regression** tasks
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Download prediction results as CSV

## Workflow

1. Upload a CSV file
2. Preview and clean data
3. Perform exploratory data analysis
4. Select feature variables and target variable
5. Choose problem type (classification or regression)
6. Train a machine learning model
7. Review model performance and predictions
8. Download prediction results
